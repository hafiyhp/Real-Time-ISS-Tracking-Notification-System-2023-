## Space Exploration and Communication Automation Project ##

Welcome to my Space Exploration and Communication Automation Project, showcasing the use of APIs and automation for space-related data.

## Project Overview
The Space Exploration and Communication Automation Project is a demonstration of my skills and knowledge in leveraging APIs to automate data retrieval and communication. This project focuses on two key aspects:

Sunrise and Sunset Data: Utilizing the "Sunrise-Sunset" API, I fetch data related to sunrise and sunset times based on geographical coordinates. The goal was to obtain precise timing information for day and night transitions at any location.

International Space Station (ISS) Tracking: With the "Open Notify" API, I retrieved real-time data on the ISS's location. This involved accessing the ISS's latitude and longitude, providing an excellent opportunity to explore space exploration data.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project were:

Retrieve sunrise and sunset data for any location on Earth using the "Sunrise-Sunset" API.
Access real-time information on the International Space Station's position with the "Open Notify" API.
Combine both datasets to automate communication based on specific conditions.

## Key Achievements
1. Retrieving Sunrise and Sunset Data
I successfully implemented the retrieval of sunrise and sunset data using the "Sunrise-Sunset" API. This allowed me to obtain accurate timing information for daylight and nighttime hours, which is crucial for various applications.

2. Real-time ISS Tracking
With the "Open Notify" API, I accessed real-time data about the International Space Station's location. This presented an opportunity to work with space-related data and explore its potential applications.

3. Combining Sunrise/Sunset and ISS Data
The highlight of the project was combining the sunrise/sunset data with ISS tracking. I implemented an automation script to:

Check if the ISS was close to a specific location.
Determine whether it was currently dark.
Send an email notification to look up if these conditions were met.
Usage
The project demonstrates the use of APIs, data manipulation, automation, and email communication. The code can be found in the project's Python script.

## Future Developments
This project provides a foundation for further exploration of space and communication automation. Future developments may include:

a) Enhancing the notification system with additional conditions.
b) Expanding the project to cover more space-related data sources.
c) Developing a user-friendly application for space enthusiasts.
